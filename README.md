- This is a private osu! standard 1v1 single elimination tourney and will only be hosted for No Title discord server.
- If you are not in No Title but you got this link, you can play the tournament if you join No Title discord server (of course before the time registration closes).

- The requirement of ranks for this tournament is #50k-#150k. The buffers are 2k, that means if you are in around #48k-#152k, you are still allowed to join the tournament. The rank will be locked down at the time the registration closes, after that, you can set your rank whatever you want.
- If you change ingame name or discord name/tag, please let us know as soon as possible.
- All the matches will be streamed and commentated if at the same time, there are no 2 or more matches. If there are more than two matches at same time, streamer will decide which match to go live. [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/rocktwitchtv) will be used for streaming.
- The updates and annoucement will often be posted at [Updates_and_Announcements.md](https://github.com/fireser/rocktwitchtv-osu-tournament/blob/master/Updates_and_Announcements.md) in Github and in No Title server. DM rock-on#9446 or post in [Issues](https://github.com/fireser/rocktwitchtv-osu-tournament/issues) or the server if you have any questions.
- As you can see, this tournament is posted in Github but not any blog or elsewhere,... That's right, I made and a C++ application for this tournament. The program is not something special, it has ability to show users about rules, mappool, important links,... ect, I use all of my current university knowledge to do it.
- You can download the program at [here](https://github.com/fireser/rocktwitchtv-osu-tournament/releases).

**Match Rules:**
- Respect to the referee and the players, if we found that you behave offensively, you can have a chance to be disqualified.
- All matches will be 1v1, HeadToHead, ScoreV2.
- Only Final has BO9 format. Everything else are BO7.
- There will be a referee invite you before each matches 15 minutes. Besure to be active in osu! at that time.
- If one of players doesn't show up at the lobby at scheduled time, they have 10 minutes to show up. If that player doesn't show up after 10 minutes, the match will be defaulted to the one in the lobby. If both players fail to show up, both players will be disqualified.
- When both players are in lobby, the referee will tell players to roll. Higher roll will get first warmup pick, second ban and first pick.
- There are total 2 warmups, 2 bans.
- Warmups must be lower than 5 minutes.
- If any of players disconnect during the match for first 30 seconds, the match will be replayed, else, the point will go toward to the  other. If a player disconected in the lobby, they have 10 minutes to show ups.
- Time to pick and bans is 90 seconds. If a player failed to pick, ban after this time, the opponent will be allowed to pick/ban. The time can be reduced or increased depends on the referee.
- For FM maps, players are forced to pick at least one mod. The range of mods are HR, HD, EZ, FL. You can stack these mods for    higher score if you want. This rule applies for Tiebreaker as well, but for Tiebreaker, you are not forced to pick any mods at all.
- If the match ends in a tie, the tiebreaker will be played.
- During a song, if you failed at the end, your score will not be counted. If both players failed at the end, player who has higher   score will still be counted as winnner of the song.
